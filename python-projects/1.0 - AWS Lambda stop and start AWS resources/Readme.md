Create a Python AWS Lambda function that starts and stops AWS resources (such as EC2 instances or RDS databases) during non-business hours using Boto3.

Prerequisites
1. AWS Lambda Execution Role: Ensure your Lambda function has an IAM role with the necessary permissions to start and stop the resources.
2. AWS SDK for Python (Boto3): This is used to interact with AWS services from Python code.
